      <p> rassimkhelifa at gmail.com<br />
      Postdoc Fellow</p>
		<p>My general interest lies at the interface of environmental sciences and evolutionary biology and involves life history plasticity, dispersal ecology, sexual selection, and conservation biology.
My current research  focuses on  changes in the distribution range of odonates across latitude and elevation in Europe. My main questions are: what drives the variability in the range shift of species? How can we predict future range dynamics of communities? How species respond to climate change across different geographic gradients.<br />
My previous postdoc research, which was conducted with Prof. Stefan Lüpold at UZH, focuses on understanding whether female choice depends on intrinsic male quality or male-female genetic compatibility. I am also interested in how toxins (pesticides) change female choice, male performance, genetic compatibility and ultimately sexual selection. To this end, I use laboratory experiments on <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>. With my team consisting of postdocs and PhDs in Algeria, we carry out regular surveys to characterize the odonatological and avian fauna of the country and identify the threats that endanger the persistence of species. We also use citizen science and take into account the cultural aspect of society to effectively come up with solutions to establish effective conservation plans.

		<p>Mackenzie's PhD research focuses on understanding the demographic pathways and genetic consequences of range expansion. She is interested in expanding on current evolutionary theory that predicts negative fitness consequences resulting from range expansion--or expansion load--by developing new models and conducting empirical investigations using natural populations of <i>Mimulus lewisii</i> along contrasting spatiotemporal scales (e.g., latitudinal and elevational gradients). Specifically, she aims to identify when and where we would expect the accumulation of expansion load to negatively impact long-term persistence of edge-populations in nature, which has implications for population-level responses to climate change.</p>

		<p>Takuji is interested in the eco-evolutionary processes that govern changes to species distributions. In response to environmental change, he is interested in the role of: (1) selective and stochastic evolutionary processes; and (2) species interactions in determining population dynamics at both the leading edge (e.g. range expansion) and trailing edge (e.g. evolutionary rescue) of the species range. In addition to these disequilibrial dynamics, he is further interested in the demographic and genetic processes that shape equilibrial (i.e. fitness and niche limited) range limits. To explore these themes, Takuji is currently setting up a novel, lab replicated species ‘range’ using multiple coexisting species of duckweed. Through utilizing experimental evolution, he will run lab experiments to study the effects of evolution on range dynamics in real time.</p>
