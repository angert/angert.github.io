Transfered files and pages to git hub repositry

Issues: 
gallery - the "hover and click" option doesn't always work, this may be someting with the CSS?
I also managed to shift the other two picture sections to the left, not sure how, and when code is identiocal to the old iversion this still happens; need to fix
Need to figure out what size thumbnails are (easy to do) and save any other pic that is to go in the gallery as the same size. Right now, the newest pic is too big and is cutting off the text under the picture.

need to go through all links and update
Otherwise, things are looking good! ready to add more bios
