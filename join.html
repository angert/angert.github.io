                  <h3>My philosophy </h3>
                  <p>My goal as an advisor is to help you become broadly trained in ecology, evolution, and their application to conservation while developing an independent body of research that is in line with your interests and career goals. You may work on your own system or under the umbrella of one of my research systems, but in either case it is important that you learn to identify interesting questions and creative, feasible approaches as an independent researcher. This process is fun and rewarding, but it is also a lot of hard work. To succeed you must be  committed to your project and the process of graduate school. In return, I am committed to mentoring my students and I will be available for regular one-on-one meetings and advice. You should plan to be engaged in lab meetings, journal clubs, and seminars and to interact with other lab groups on campus. Read more about lab philosophy and expectations <a href="AngertLabExpectations.pdf">here</a>.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h3>First steps</h3>
                  <p><strong>Undergraduate students</strong>: If you are interested in gaining hands-on research experience in plant ecology and evolution, please email a resume and a one-page statement of interest.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p><strong>Graduate students</strong>: I am potentially interested in recruiting a new M.Sc. student to begin in fall 2021. <em><strong>I will not be able to accept new graduate students without their own fellowship funding. </strong></em>If you are a strong candidate for independent fellowship awards (i.e. NSERC CGS/PGS), then please email the following: 1) a description of your academic and work background, 2) your research interests, 3) why you want to go to grad school and your longer term career goals, and 4) why you're interested in UBC and my lab in particular. Please specify whether you are interested in a MSc or PhD. <em><strong>Please note: I begin screening prospective applicants in the  late fall or early winter and probably will not reply to your email until that time.</strong></em></p>
                  <br/>
